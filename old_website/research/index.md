My research is in the field of Undergraduate Mathematics Education. To see publications, see my [research gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matt_Thomas3) or [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=BiK7h4AAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

I am currently working on understanding how students interact with and learn from calculus videos as part of the [Calculus Videos Project](http://calcvids.github.io).

During graduate school, I was involved in the TeKno research project. More about this project is [here](https://sites.google.com/site/teknoresearchsite/home).
